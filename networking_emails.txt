Subject: Let's Connect: Exploring Common Grounds in AI/ML

Hello Kshitij,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently came across your profile on LinkedIn while exploring connections that share a passion for AI/ML and found your background particularly inspiring! 

I’m currently engaged in software engineering with a core focus on Python, C++, Java, and Machine Learning, similar to your expertise. I believe there's a lot we can share from our experiences, especially around system design and data solutions for cloud environments. 

I’d love to learn more about your work at Audible and discuss potential overlaps in our interests. Are you open to connecting here and perhaps scheduling a time to chat further?

Best Regards,

[Your Name]

Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well! I came across your profile on LinkedIn and was impressed by your extensive experience with full-stack development using Java and JavaScript at AWS, as well as your contributions to the open-source community. As a fellow software engineer with a strong background in Python, Machine Learning, C++, and Java, I believe we have much in common.

I'm particularly interested in your work with Kafka Cascade. I've worked on similar projects and am eager to discuss how we can leverage our shared knowledge in data science and software development for mutual benefit.

Could we set up a time to chat? Here's a link to my GitHub if you'd like to take a look at some of my projects: [Insert GitHub Link]

Thanks and looking forward to connecting,
