His deep understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript, Kafka, Node.js/Express, unit testing, deployment, and knowledge of Agile and project management kept us on track and the product launch on schedule. Not only was he an incredibly effective engineer and project manager, he was also generous with his time and was always willing to give guidance and code review.

Building on previous investigations, Rutgers CAIT proposed to navigate a tethered, helium filled vinyl non-rigid airship (Blimp) with a mounted camera pan/tilt assembly. The equipment is remotely operated from the ground through a control device that displays images from the camera attached to the blimp. Levers allow the user to adjust pitch and roll as well as zoom and capture of still images.Testing was performed in May 2011, at two separate highway-rail crossings, including Industrial Avenue, South Brunswick, New Jersey; and Raritan Center Parkway, Edison, New Jersey. Images collected were analyzed and mapped using AutoCAD 2012, student version. Missing background imaging, resulting from gaps between images and ancillary to the study, at an acceptable distance from the crossing, was cropped in from readily available internet based mapping. An appropriate scale was determined by comparing the actual street width and subsequent measurement of the photographed street using the software. Based on the appropriate scale, sight triangles were calculated, drawn and superimposed onto the “stitched” imaging. Excess vegetation and other obstructions were identified and cataloged.The technology provides a low-cost, simple mechanism to image, identify and catalog needed maintenance at highway-rail crossings. Due to the dense network of overhead utility infrastructure as well as heavily traveled highways, the technology is limited in its application within the state of New Jersey. However, other states may have a higher frequency of crossings with no overhead obstructions. These states should be identified and presented with the opportunity to apply this low-cost method for monitoring and maintaining these crossings."}],"organizations":[{"title":"American Society of Civil Engineers","membership_type":"Younger Member Group Vice President and Practitioner Advisor to Rutgers University Student Chapter","start_date":"Sep 2006","end_date":"Present","description":"Practitioner Advisor to Rutgers University Student ChapterMember of the 2009 and 2010 ASCE Steel Bridge Competition","membership_number":null}],"location":"New York","input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-weber-jr","linkedin_id":"michael-weber-jr","activity":[{"interaction":"Liked by Michael Weber, P.E.","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/somsubhrochatterjee_finops-costoptimization-pricingcalculator-activity-7271203552486686720-PraV","title":"The fever pitch of launching the new AWS Pricing Calculator gripped myself and the team for most of 2024.

The need for such an intelligent system to monitor our homes arises out of growing concerns about felonies, security threats as well as our desire to make our lives more comfortable. Also in the present scenario, many older couples are forced to live on their own in houses that fall very short on optimum security measures and emergency services due to various socio-economic reasons. Generally older people are seen as soft targets by callous offenders. Another grave problem faced by the senior citizens is their inability to get timely help in case of physical injuries while at home as they are debilitating to a great effect. This again puts them under harm's way. Hence we have come up with a unique system called ProGuard that not only takes care of these aforementioned security issue, but also provides enough luxury and adaptability to the milieu to make the lives of people using it secure and comfortable. The simulation software used by us is proteus."}],"projects":[{"title":"Next word prediction using deep neural networks","start_date":"Apr 2016","description":"Devised a model to predict the next word based on the current user input using the n-gram model, Long short term memory (LSTM) neural network and Gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network.

I would jump at the chance to work with him again. What makes Steve so great? He's trained as an engineer and a designer. And I can't tell you which came first because his skills are so sharp on both ends. When Steve gets a project to work on, he makes sure he understands the user's motivation, the business case, and the engineering challenges to be tackled now, and the implications in the future. He's not the type to get a clearly flawed brief and go off an execute on it because someone said he should. He'll ask the tough questions and collaborate to get the best answers before building. That's how you can be sure the projects Steve works on will be done, done well, on time, and provide value to both your users and the business. To be clear, you'd be crazy not to work with Steve if you have the chance.”"],"followers":302,"connections":298,"current_company_company_id":"amazon-web-services","current_company_name":"Amazon Web Services (AWS)","location":"Alexandria","input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/steveskladany","linkedin_id":"steveskladany","activity":[{"interaction":"Liked by Steve Skladany","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mitchellst_where-ive-been-a-request-for-help-let-activity-7285696590055411713-tSTx","title":"Where I've been + a request for help Let’s call it a mini-retirement.

almost two years for various data science, marketing analytics and quantitative risk management projects. He is a well-rounded data scientist with solid statistical and computational skills. He uses these skills to provide efficient data science solutions for various industries. He has a very good understanding of enterprise level data science applications. Whether it is about using programming languages, especially, Python/SAS/R, applying relevant machine learning algorithms, integrating models with other software systems, or managing technical and non-technical aspects of projects, he is very adept. Pathik has keen interest in not just attaining deep insight and the story behind the data but also presenting analytics solutions accordingly to various stakeholders. Overall, I highly recommend Pathik if you are looking to develop innovative machine learning solutions, build risk models or solve business problems using data science.”","Michael A.

Recently, researchers have created automated machine learning algorithms to detect Cyberbullying using social and textual features. However, the very algorithms that are intended to fight off one threat (cyberbullying) may inadvertently be falling prey to another important threat (bias of the automatic detection algorithms). This is exacerbated by the fact that while the current literature on algorithmic fairness has multiple empirical results, metrics, and algorithms for countering bias across immediately observable demographic characteristics (e.g. age, race, gender), there have been no efforts at empirically quantifying the variation in algorithmic performance based on the network role or position of individuals. We audit an existing cyberbullying algorithm using Twitter data for disparity in detection performance based on the network centrality of the potential victim and then demonstrate how this disparity can be countered using an Equalized Odds post-processing technique. The results pave way for more accurate and fair cyberbullying detection algorithms."}],"projects":[{"title":"Personal Website","start_date":"May 2020","end_date":"Present","description":"To better my AWS and HTML knowledge I have been designing a website that utilizes S3, Route 53, Certificate Managers and am currently working on migrating this to a Fargate based architecture to make the website more dynamic and make use of microservices for backend projects."},{"title":"FRC 2590 Nemesis","start_date":"Sep 2014","end_date":"Present","description":"Programming robots for FIRST Robotics Team Nemesis 2590, an award winning team from New Jersey.

I was impressed with his ability to learn new technology quickly and tailor it to the project requirements. He has excellent verbal and written communication skills. He worked with teams across multiple time zones and was always respectful in his conduct. He asked appropriate questions to gather the necessary information for the project.

Amit has a great blend of technical and business knowledge along with an absolute drive to deliver business outcomes through great engineering and strong partnership with his clients. Kudos to Amit for his additional personal time and effort he spends volunteering - it's very nice to see a person give back to the community and build his team with the right values. A great guy and someone I have greatly enjoyed working with\"”","Yuri Greenfield “For about 6 years, Amit has been the head of IT for the corporate lending book I ran. During that time he built an operational model that provided a great deal of transparency and value to my team on various IT deliverables and the associated efforts and costs. I feel we got more IT work done with Amit’s team on its modest budget than other teams with multiple of his budget and headcount. We selected Amit to head up our team having interviewed literally dozens of candidates, and he stood out as the most outstanding professional with a great personality and leadership skills. But he surpassed even our highest expectations by building a team of the highest quality in Cary, NC - entirely from scratch. Amit is well respected within the DB Cary community, and he leads other initiatives there such as STEM projects for local schools on behalf of Deutsche Bank. He was recently given an award for his efforts by the County School administration board. He also completed an executive MBA program at Columbia University on his own accord. I greatly value Amit’s insights that he brings into articulating feasible technical solutions. He is methodical and thoughtful in every interaction. He also deeply cares for his team and strives to be a role model for them. I wholeheartedly recommend Amit as a top-quality tech lead.”"],"volunteer_experience":[{"cause":"Education","duration":"Jan 2021 - Present · 4 years 1 month","duration_short":"4 years 1 month","end_date":"Present","start_date":"Jan 2021","subtitle":"Goodnight Scholars Program","title":"Mentor"},{"cause":"Education","duration":"Jul 2018 - Present · 6 years 7 months","duration_short":"6 years 7 months","end_date":"Present","info":"Mentoring Senior Comp Sci Undergraduate students","start_date":"Jul 2018","subtitle":"North Carolina State University","title":"Mentor"},{"cause":"Education","duration":"Jun 2016 - Present · 8 years 8 months","duration_short":"8 years 8 months","end_date":"Present","start_date":"Jun 2016","subtitle":"Wake County Public School System","title":"STEM - Mentor"}],"followers":362,"connections":331,"current_company_company_id":"amazon","current_company_name":"Amazon","location":"Cary","input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitrahalkar","linkedin_id":"amitrahalkar","activity":[{"interaction":"Liked by Amit Rahalkar","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertfischer_im-starting-my-masters-of-computer-science-activity-7280716999024861184-X1XX","title":"I'm starting my Masters of Computer Science degree at Georgia Tech School of Computational Science and Engineering and my first two courses will be…","img":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/53n89ecoxpr1qrki1do3alazb","id":"7280716999024861184"},{"interaction":"Liked by Amit Rahalkar","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertfischer_theres-a-trap-of-assuming-that-llms-think-activity-7273510060989771776-qwgi","title":"There's a trap of assuming that LLMs \"think\" like people do and will therefore rationalize their thinking like people do.

Dat's cost analysis work has immediately helped us translate business strategy into tactical engineering decision making- with amazing outcomes. From an analysis of cloud to colocaion, Dat helped us re-structure the way we think and communicate our strategic operational web infrastructure costs, while providing frameworks and tools to manage and project costs moving forward- touching nearly every group in the business. To immerse himself in the Ops process, Dat picked up and dove into classic sysadmin work- hands on helping deploy new clusters of UNIX systems in colocation and cloud environments, building and securing physical networks from scratch, and moving complicated applications between various POP's. Along with the new builds, Dat worked with us moving legacy hardware, software, stitching together legacy networks, and automating various tasks with scripts. Dat transcended his internship for his Ops work, picking up and becoming a valuable sysadmin contributor to every aspect of this massive team undertaking, and can certainly handle himself in a datacenter. If he weren't a business analyst, Dat could become a heck of a UNIX sysadmin. As a business analyst, Dat's calm no nonsense approach is a force to be reckoned with- I look forward to seeing where Dat aims his talents through his career!”"],"volunteer_experience":[{"cause":"Children","duration":"Sep 2012 - May 2013 · 9 months","duration_short":"9 months","end_date":"May 2013","info":"Assisted teachers with the care of homeless and economically disadvantaged children.

I wanted our attendees to be exposed to a broad range of ideas and concepts that were relevant to their lives and experiences.When the day of the event finally arrived, it was heartening to see the turnout. Over 2,000 people attended the event, and the energy in the room was palpable. Our speakers delivered thought-provoking talks that covered a range of topics, from environmental conservation to mental health, and their insights resonated with the audience.Following the event, I was thrilled to see that the talks had gained traction online. With over 1,000,000 views since the event, it was clear that the ideas shared at TEDxYouth@LakeManalapan had struck a chord with people far beyond our local community.Overall, the experience of organizing TEDxYouth@LakeManalapan was incredibly rewarding.

In that time, he was responsible for initiating new partnerships with some of the largest tech firms in the world, including IBM, Microsoft, Intel, Snowflake, Lenovo, and AWS, while also maintaining and expanding existing relationships. In two specific instances, June successfully negotiated complex technical integration partnerships with two Fortune 100 tech firms. These negotiations involved their engineering and business development teams and spanned several months. June orchestrated internal resources while maintaining the necessary velocity to finalize agreements that positively impacted our fiscal plans. His deep understanding of data science, machine learning, and AI, coupled with his ability to articulate these concepts to non-technical audiences, was invaluable. In a company filled with “A” players, June stood out. Often, his role required him to marshal internal resources to deliver on the vision of a partnership. He effectively communicated with me and the rest of the C-suite, clearly demonstrating the value and necessity of dedicating resources to specific partnerships. June was one of the few people I could rely on for clarity regarding partner situations. He had a remarkable ability to break down complex problems into their core components, making them easier to address. I do not say this lightly—June’s impact on Anaconda was immense, and I would work with him again without hesitation.”","Carly (Tschantz) Grandfield “June has been my counterpart in the AI partnerships space, and his knowledge, experience and operational mindset has made him part of a respected cohort of colleagues I rely on for insights and perspective on the market. His ability to piece together workstreams and activities to serve a larger strategic vision is unmatched. Our world is always a balancing act of outcomes vs outputs and ensuring the ROI attached to all outputs drive an outcome. June exemplifies how this can be done at scale and benefiting both startup and large technology companies he engages with.”"],"followers":1383,"connections":500,"current_company_company_id":"amazon-web-services","current_company_name":"Amazon Web Services (AWS)","location":null,"input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/june-johnnie-c-8b312719","linkedin_id":"june-johnnie-c-8b312719","activity":null,"linkedin_num_id":"63009351","banner_image":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D16AQHmEi0baJPoOQ/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_200_800/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_200_800/0/1561221098602?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=r9AFvl5wLkmRykNWZDpNGeXWfK3X0jddS5KreqYrmM4","honors_and_awards":null,"similar_profiles":[{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlespgarcia","name":"Charles P.

His ability to understand and dissect a wide array of issues is second to none. He is a team player who always goes the extra mile to see that issues are fully resolved in a timely manner. He has a special ability to diagnose areas that lack efficiency and devise plans and create programs to improve them. Matt is an extremely valuable asset to the hundreds of people in our company and I highly recommend him.”","Michael Giarlo “Matt sees the forest and the trees; he is meticulous in his attention to detail without losing sight of overarching goals and outcomes. His duties as Unit Computing Specialist put him at the forefront of our organization, where multi-tasking and friendly public services are absolutely essential. He handled all aspects of the position with skill, balance, and poise, and volunteered often to help his peers. In his role as coordinator of student and part-time employees, I can say with confidence that he had the respect of all whom he supervised and was a mentor to many. I was on the search committee that hired Matt, and I was glad to have him aboard. He was an asset to the organization, a reliable and knowledgeable colleague, and a droll, affable guy to have around. I would highly recommend this multi-talented individual for a broad spectrum of positions: desktop computing, systems administration, project management, network analyst, and software engineer, to name a few.”"],"followers":779,"connections":500,"projects":[{"title":"Random Bits of Code","start_date":"Jun 2012","end_date":"Present"}],"location":"New York","input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattmedeiros","linkedin_id":"mattmedeiros","activity":[{"interaction":"Liked by Matt Medeiros","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cindypollackevans_this-weekend-i-spoke-to-the-sterling-estates-activity-7269413097734291456-tlT3","title":"This weekend, I spoke to the Sterling Estates Senior Living Communities about how to be mindful of Scams and how to stay safe in the digital age…","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQG8pwV1y3cmTA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1733163140642?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=c9r9JUkxI9ukan5eAsGIvtN0NvAdOay3z1gb66StduY","id":"7269413097734291456"},{"interaction":"Liked by Matt Medeiros","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-merewitz_you-really-care-about-your-people-and-team-activity-7267554911414849536-yoIq","title":"\"You really care about your people and team and doing the right things.\" After 4.5 years, I'm wrapping up my last week at Amazon and as I've shared…","img":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/53n89ecoxpr1qrki1do3alazb","id":"7267554911414849536"},{"interaction":"Liked by Matt Medeiros","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-merewitz_people-often-wont-remember-exactly-what-activity-7261777461972029440-8vqn","title":"People often won't remember exactly what you did or said, but they will remember how you made them feel.

He always leads by example, often rivaling his most experienced team members in terms of thought leadership. But most importantly, he stops at nothing to ensure that his team always has his support in even the most difficult of circumstances (whether internal or customer facing). In the end, this approach invariably leads to success for the organization.”","LinkedIn User “Ed is the dream manager one can think of! No hyperbole here. I found Ed to be technically knowledgeable without being a micro manager of how to do things technically. I appreciate Ed's honesty and openness. His people management skill is exceptional which is shown by the large multi-million dollar deals he himself pulls off and guides his team to win. He makes sure that every person in his team gets exposure for the work they do which is a rare occurrence these days when everybody is out to take undeserved credit.

Am. Chem. Soc.","date":"August 14, 2017","description":"Radical templation centered around a heterotrisradical tricationic inclusion complex DB•+⊂DAPQT2(•+), assembled from an equimolar mixture of a disubstituted 4,4′-bipyridinium radical cation (DB•+) and an asymmetric cyclophane bisradical dication (DAPQT2(•+)), affords a symmetric [2]catenane (SC·7PF6) and an asymmetric [2]catenane (AC·7PF6) on reaction of the 1:1 complex with diazapyrene and bipyridine, respectively. Both these highly charged [2]catenanes have been isolated as air-stable monoradicals and characterized by EPR spectroscopy. X-ray crystallography suggests that the unpaired electrons are delocalized in each case across two inner 4,4′-bipyridinium (BIPY2+) units forming a mixed-valence (BIPY2)•3+ state inside both [2]catenanes, an observation which is in good agreement with spin-density calculations using density functional theory. Electrochemical studies indicate that by replacing the BIPY2+ units in homo[2]catenane HC•7+—composed of two mechanically interlocked cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) rings—with “zero”, one, and two more highly conjugated diazapyrenium dication (DAP2+) units, respectively, a consecutive series of five, six, and seven redox states can be accessed in the resulting SC·7PF6 (0, 4+, 6+, 7+, and 8+), HC·7PF6 (0, 2+, 4+, 6+, 7+, and 8+), and AC·7PF6 (0, 1+, 2+, 4+, 6+, 7+, and 8+), respectively. These unique [2]catenanes present a promising prototype for the fabrication of high-density data memories."},{"title":"Radically promoted formation of a molecular lasso","subtitle":"Chem. Sci.","date":"January 16, 2017","description":"Two potential viologen-based molecular lasso precursors—both composed of a 4,4′-bipyridinium (BIPY2+) unit as part of a rope appended to a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT4+) loop—that have been designed to mimic the threading/unthreading motion of lasso peptides, have been synthesised and characterised. Solution and solid-state experiments reveal that, when the BIPY2+ unit in the rope and the CBPQT4+ loop are connected by a bulky linker, no lasso-like conformational transformation is observed between the different redox states on account of steric effects. In sharp contrast, when the linker size is small, the molecule can be switched between (i) a free rope-like conformation in its fully oxidised state and (ii) a self-entangled lasso-like conformation under reducing conditions employing either chemical or electrochemical stimuli: the BIPY˙+ unit in the rope resides inside the cavity of the CBPQT2(˙+) loop, forming a pseudo[1]rotaxane. The switching process is reversible and stereochemically unambiguous. This research shows how tiny structural differences can induce significantly different self-complexing properties and sheds light on designing functional artificial actuators."},{"title":"A Redox-Active Bistable Molecular Switch Mounted inside a Metal–Organic Framework","subtitle":"J. Am. Chem. Soc. (Equal Contribution)","date":"October 24, 2016","description":"We describe the incorporation of a bistable mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM) into a robust Zr-based metal–organic framework (MOF), NU-1000, by employing a post-synthetic functionalization protocol. On average, close to two bistable [2]catenanes can be incorporated per repeating unit of the hexagonal channels of NU-1000. The reversible redox-switching of the bistable [2]catenanes is retained inside the MOF, as evidenced by solid-state UV-vis-NIR reflectance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. This research demonstrates that bistable MIMs are capable of exhibiting robust dynamics inside the nanopores of a MOF."},{"title":"Symbiotic Control in Mechanical Bond Formation","subtitle":"Angew.

The arduino was then programmed to use that LED matrix as a screen and display a representation of Conway's Game of Life. The Game of Life is zero player game that is a two dimensional cellular automaton. Using an orthogonal grid of squares which can be considered either in “live or dead” states, patterns can be generated from iterating a set of rules. Originally, the game was conceptualized on a Go board with the black and white game pieces representing the live or dead states.

He tackles new and unfamiliar technologies with ease. Nik also has a positive attitude that is both refreshing and contagious. I count him among the most talented people I've worked with. Nik and I worked together on multiple projects over the 2010 to 2012 time frame.”","Giselle Ri, PMP “I had the pleasure of working with Nik during Colgate’s implementation of BPC 7.5 NW for Capital Planning. Nik has without a doubt very strong technical skills. He is well versed in all aspects of SAP BPC. He has a deep understanding of the application’s structure and capabilities. Nik utilized his knowledge of SAP Web Dynpro and BADIs to generate master data on the fly and enhance business process flows. From a project management perspective, his ability to quickly grasp business processes and ask the right questions enables him to manage projects successfully. But what impressed me the most about Nik is his ability to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions that meet business needs. Nik goes above and beyond to deliver a world-class solution. Whether he was developing a system, driving meetings or managing projects, Nik demonstrated that he is a self-starter and a well rounded business professional. Dependable, hard-working and a joy to work with, Nik fosters a friendly and productive work environment. I know Nik will excel in any endeavor he takes on.

Car sharing (e.g., Zipcar and car2go), as an emerging App-based online shared mobility mode, has been increasing exponentially worldwide in recent years. However, to date, comprehensive user behavior in car sharing systems has not been investigated, which is essential for understanding their characteristics and promotion roadblocks. With the goal of understanding various facets of user behavior in these systems, in this paper, we performed a qualitative and quantitative user study by adopting a mixed-methods approach. We designed an attitude-aware online survey with a set of qualitative questions to perceive people’s subjective attitudes to online car sharing. We then quantitatively analyzed a year long real world car sharing operation data which involves over 68,000 unique users & over 587,850 usages. We dissected this attitude-free data to understand the objective car sharing user behavior from different dimensions, e.g., spatial, temporal, and demographic. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative study by utilizing one-year data from other two representative cities to show if the obtained findings from earlier data may be generalizable. We also do a case study by designing a user behavior-aware usage prediction model (i.e., BeXGBoost) based on findings from our user study (e.g., unbalanced spatiotemporal usage patterns, weekly regularity, demographic-related usage difference, and low-frequency revisitation), which is the basis for car sharing service station deployment and vehicle rebalancing. We summarize the findings obtained from our study about unique user behavior in online car sharing systems, combined with some detailed discussions about implications for design."}],"location":"San Francisco","input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh-vaish","linkedin_id":"harsh-vaish","activity":[{"interaction":"Liked by Harsh Rajkumar","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nishmit_this-promises-to-be-a-great-conferencelooking-activity-7252033433466511361-qflh","title":"This promises to be a great conference!Looking forward to meeting many clients who are industry leaders and expert risk practitioners over the next 3…","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQGevUKUqhz_iw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1728636044079?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Gf8H3eGkI3_KQXk0gJ_52Tcf85bisCe76AWnhcGfwoQ","id":"7252033433466511361"},{"interaction":"Liked by Harsh Rajkumar","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shaleen-gupta_ask-questions-in-new-ways-with-ai-in-search-activity-7249839268959789058-enQO","title":"Search just got a whole lot tastier! 🙌 Can't wait to see how people use these new features!","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/v2/D4E27AQE-986kCPYOcw/articleshare-shrink_800/articleshare-shrink_800/0/1727971535537?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=M3GMbW7ifBDnDm2odQK60fjw2D36sNIgGpcmCBHD50Y","id":"7249839268959789058"},{"interaction":"Liked by Harsh Rajkumar","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-marchese-71b3501a8_im-happy-to-share-that-ive-been-promoted-activity-7244786598662324224-jjAo","title":"I’m happy to share that I’ve been promoted to Software Development Engineer (SDE) II at Amazon!","img":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/53n89ecoxpr1qrki1do3alazb","id":"7244786598662324224"},{"interaction":"Liked by Harsh Rajkumar","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/just-in-amazon-is-increasing-the-average-activity-7242176324570693633-1_Om","title":"Just in: Amazon is increasing the average total compensation package for front-line fulfillment and transportation employees in the U.S. to over $29…","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQEasQ4LmkXDoA/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1726669384886?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=T3hGQJkKbxgw_HioduzaxeG1qXJI-Uqppk5HjA7ySII","id":"7242176324570693633"},{"interaction":"Liked by Harsh Rajkumar","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shailshah9_abstracting-kubernetes-how-intuit-is-migrating-activity-7241668659939573762-ILn_","title":"🚀 Excited to announce that I’ll be presenting at Cloud Native Rejekts (#Rejekts2024) in Salt Lake City on November 11th at 11:30 AM! 🎙️🎉 Together…","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/v2/D5627AQEei99d7F9fqw/articleshare-shrink_800/articleshare-shrink_800/0/1726548167154?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=oZtojbu-isO7oLVCH-AlOD-K5eHl-FrNJuHyAWvDXHo","id":"7241668659939573762"},{"interaction":"Liked by Harsh Rajkumar","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jatayu-baxi-09397011_excited-to-share-that-by-the-grace-of-god-activity-7235291896783241216-OExX","title":"Excited to share that, by the grace of God, I successfully defended my PhD thesis last week.

taste profile respecting the geographical proximities of the user. We worked with the Yelp Academic Dataset, performed sentiment analysis of users to do better item based filtering, bining and bloom filtering to accommodate the expected geographical boundaries of users."},{"title":"Polyhedron feasibility using Triangle Algorithm ","start_date":"Feb 2018","end_date":"May 2018","description":"We used Triangle algorithm which solves the Convex Hull Membership problem to solve Polyhedron feasibility using Farkas' Lemma. CHM problem occurs extensively in theoretical machine learning. Our Polyhedron feasibility using Triangle algorithm can be used in various ML applications."},{"title":"Colorizing Grayscale Images using CNN's","start_date":"Nov 2017","end_date":"Jan 2018","description":"We trained a Convolutional Neural Network on Grayscale images to learn 'Representation Patch' to Pixel function to efficiently reduce the color Gamut (\"set of crayons\") and color the given Grayscale image to a full RGB based pixel image. We learned that a pixel can efficiently be learned by capturing its surrounding pixels and learning a relative function instead to Grayscale pixel - Colored Pixel mapping, thus, we define a 3x3 pixel matrix as a 'patch' and learn matrix to colored pixel mapping. We also reduce the color gamut by defining a 'Representation Color' for each possible color by clustering 256x256x256 color values of a pixel into a few clusters and using the cluster heads to color the image making the CNN learn only 'Representation colors' instead of the entire color gamut."},{"title":"Clustering Analysis and Classification of Instagram","start_date":"Sep 2017","end_date":"Dec 2017","description":"The project dealt with clustering Instagram accounts and classifying them into multiple classes. The benefit of this application is to provide insight into the underlying clusters across top accounts on one of the most influential social networks, and also has business and content consumption impacts. The main stumbling blocks were collecting and coding the data, and clustering appropriately for the mixture of numerical and categorical attributes. Scale and timeline was controlled by showing analysis and classification for the top 100 accounts."},{"title":"Probabilistic Agent Learning for Target Hunting ","start_date":"Sep 2017","end_date":"Dec 2017","description":"The Project focuses itself on probabilistically hunting a target in an arbitrary landscape composed of cells with different difficulties of searching a target. I designed a learning algorithm to build an agent that models knowledge/belief about a system probabilistically and updates its knowledge using Bayesian learning approach to direct efficient future directions. We extend our algorithm to two use cases: 1) When the target is stationary 2) When the target is moving. We also study agent's dependance on various cost functions and strategies of search and compare them for minimization of total searches taken to successfully hunt the target."},{"title":"Smart Minesweeper AI ","start_date":"Sep 2017","end_date":"Dec 2017","description":"Wrote a Minesweeper AI agent capable of playing/solving the game deterministically in an arbitrarily distributed mine field. This was done by mathematically modeling the logic of a rational player by devising constraint satisfaction problems and drawing inferences. We broke down the problem at each stage as solving a Linear Program accepting only integral solutions {0,1} indicating a cell containing a mine or not, respectively. We also investigated \"Chain of influence\" for each cell - a series of solved cells that lead to a conclusion about any particular unsolved cell in the Mine map and also how the AI agent can adapt when clues on opening a cell are \"optimistic\" or \"cautious\" i.e., revealing only partially correct information."},{"title":"University of Queensland,St. Lucia, Australia - Simulation Algorithms for Large Complex Random Networks","start_date":"Dec 2015","end_date":"Feb 2016","description":"Worked on Simulation algorithms for large complex random networks for various degree distribution and graph models to study and devise efficient and optimized simulation algorithms for real world problems. I also studied clustering and the speed at which this convergence occurs in random graphs and how the conditioning for degree distribution is dependent on it. Got recognition for producing an improvised version of Havel-Hakimi algorithm to draw a random graph with fixed number of stubs for a graphical degree distribution."},{"title":"Study of Combinatorial Sequences modulo a Positive Integer (Research Project)","start_date":"Jan 2015","end_date":"May 2015","description":"I worked on Investigating periodicity in last digits of various combinatorial sequences primarily, generalised Bell polynomial, r-Stirling numbers, (r1, r2,......,rp) Stirling numbers, Fubini numbers. My work is focused on development of computational and combinatorial proofs for periodicity in flexible bases and to develop a general function from period of repetition to number of digits thus obtaining congruence relations in the sequence for powers for different bases firstly, 10."},{"title":"Correlation between Social Activity and Structural Centrality Variables for effective communication flow in Social Networks","start_date":"Jan 2015","end_date":"Apr 2015","description":"The aim of the project was to find some \"influencial\" nodes in the graph without using centrality variables like clustering on a node, betweenness centrality etc. but instead using social activity parameters for users on the network such as login count, user activity measures. We then established correlations between these various structural and social activity variables and their combinations if they were viable using MATLAB and R. We initially performed it on a Smaller graph with about 100 nodes and we are trying to extend it to large graphs."}],"organizations":[{"title":"Computer Science Graduate Student Society, Rutgers University ","membership_type":"Treasurer ","start_date":"Jan 2018","end_date":"May 2019","description":"Serving as the Treasurer for Rutgers Computer Science Graduate Student Society.

I admire Nitin's clarity of thought, attention to detail, and passion to achieve perfection. He is very methodical in his approach and always executes strategies with a high level of quality and completeness. I am always impressed by his ability to think strategically, understand the big picture, as well as dig into the small details at the same time. Nitin is not only an expert software engineer but he is also an excellent manager. He is always well organized which enables him very effective in providing vision and guidance to parallel projects and leading diverse individuals in the team executing complex projects. His collaborative style and relentless pursuit of quality has fueled our passion for providing high quality products.

He displays many qualities of a good developer and inspires those around him to become even better developers. He does not limit himself in what he learns and is always open to new ideas and ways of approaching projects. He defends what he believes, will stand up for you when needed, but most importantly even when he disagrees, he finds a calm and non-arrogant way of doing such. Andrew is also very patient. He takes the time to make sure you understand and are not just saying \"yes\".

Among the other members of the team, even with him having a lower tenure, I could always count on Jason to be incredibly self sufficient, proactive, and quick to learn. When encountering a situation that required more assistance, he had no hesitations raising his hand to get further assistance or clarification to ensure that customers got the best service possible in the quickest amount of time. I was constantly amazed at the amount of information related to Salesforce products that he could gather and keep in his head on the first try, as well as his dedication to testing and fully understanding the product instead of sending information over that he didn't fully understand. He consistently embodied the values that Salesforce strives to show our customers every single day.

The U-shaped dual attention inception (DAIU) deep-learning model was designed, given the similarities between the STMap vehicle detection task and the medical image segmentation task. The inception backbone takes full advantage of diverse sizes of filters and the flexible residual learning design. The channel attention module augmented the feature extraction for the bottom layer of the UNet. The modified gated attention scheme replaced the skip connection of the original UNet to reduce irrelevant features learned from earlier encoder layers. The designed model was tested on NJ511 traffic cameras for different scenarios covering rainy, snowy, low illumination, and signalized intersections from a key, strategic arterial in New Jersey. The DAIU Net has shown better performance than other mainstream neural networks based on segmentation model evaluation metrics. The proposed scanline vehicle detection was also compared with the state-of-the-art solution for infrastructure-based traffic movement counting solution and demonstrates superior capability. The code for the proposed DAIU model and reference models has been made public with the labeled STMap data to facilitate future research."},{"title":"A Social Distancing Index: Evaluating Navigational Policies on Human Proximity using Crowd Simulations","subtitle":"MIG '20: Motion, Interaction and Games","date":"October 1, 2020","description":"The importance of social distancing for public health is well established. However, the policies and regulations regarding occupancy rates have not been designed with this in mind. While there are analytical tools and related measures that are used in practice to evaluate how the design of a built environment serves the needs of its intended occupants, these metrics cannot directly apply to the problem of preventing the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. By using a crowd-based simulator using three levels of behavior and agent control in a given environment, a novel evaluation metric for a space layout can be calculated to reflect the proclivity of maintaining a safe distance throughout the shopping experience. We refer to this metric as the Social Distancing Index (SDI), accounting for the occupancy throughput and number of distance-based violations found. Through a case study of a realistic retail store, we demonstrate the proposed platforms performance and output on multiple scenarios by changing agent-behavior, occupancy rate, and navigational guidelines."}],"location":null,"input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryhan-moghe-410126119","linkedin_id":"ryhan-moghe-410126119","activity":[{"interaction":"Liked by Ryhan Moghe","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pratmoghe_expert-panel-winning-strategy-for-cdos-in-activity-7285675621559533568-lKTI","title":"Yesterday, I had a great time hosting a panel on “Winning Strategies for CDOs in the Age of AI” with Randy Bean, Sanjeev Mohan and Jason Foster.

It has been becoming very costly for manufacturers to produce high potent thin films due to the excessive waste of materials and high energy costs. A numerical study can be used to model and optimize the CVD reactor to yield favorable operating conditions. A simple geometry consisting of a rotating susceptor and flow guide is considered. The study shows visually how the temperature changes as the carrier gases respond to the thermal transport, and the effects of rotation and buoyancy. Commercially available software is used, with modifications, and the results obtained are discussed in detail."},{"title":"Fabrication of Gallium Nitride Films in a Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor","subtitle":"Journal of Thermal Sciences","date":"July 24, 2014","description":"A numerical study has been carried out on the metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process for the fabrication of gallium nitride (GaN) thin films, which range from a few nanometers to micrometers in thickness. The numerical study is also coupled with an experimental study on the flow and thermal transport processes in the system. Of particular interest in this study is the dependence of the growth rate of GaN and of the uniformity of the film on the flow, resulting from the choice of various design and operating parameters involved in the MOCVD process. Based on an impingement type rotating-disk reactor, three-dimensional simulations have been preformed to indicate the deposition rate increases with reactor pressure, inlet velocity, and wafer rotating speed, while decreases with the precursor concentration ratio. Additionally, a better film uniformity is caused by reducing the reactor pressure, inlet velocity and wafer rotating speed, and increasing precursor concentration ratio. With the impact of wafer temperature included in this study as well, these results are expected to provide a quantitative basis for the prediction, design, and optimization of the process for the fabrication of GaN devices. The flow and the associated transport processes are discussed in detail on the basis of the results obtained to suggest approaches to improve the uniformity of thin film, minimize fluid loss, and reduce flow recirculation that could affect growth rate and uniformity."}],"projects":[{"title":"24 Hours of LeMONs","start_date":"Jan 2014","end_date":"May 2014","description":"• Designed and built a racecar with a $500 budget including the price of the car.• Worked with 5 other team members to achieve the goal of finishing the event safely. • Selected the Toyota Cressida as the vehicle of choice(RWD, 7M-GE 6 cylinder NA)• Custom spring was used to lowered vehicle center of gravity for high-speed cornering stability.• Improved vehicle braking performance by using a modified larger diameter brake rotor.• Modified vehicle cooling system to increase thermal efficiency and longevity of the engine.• Collected and monitored vehicle’s various temperatures, air/fuel ratios, and tire pressures.• Tested and adjusted vehicle parameters using collected data from test runs.• Successfully completed the entire 24 hours race session without vehicle breakdown."}],"organizations":[{"title":"Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers","membership_type":"National Conference Assistant Logistic Manager","start_date":"Jan 2018","end_date":"Present","membership_number":null},{"title":"Society of Asian Scientists and Engineer - Rutgers University Chapter","membership_type":"Founding Member and President","start_date":"Sep 2013","end_date":"May 2015","membership_number":null},{"title":"American Society of Mechanical Engineering","membership_type":"General Member","membership_number":null},{"title":"American Society of Quality","membership_type":"General Member","membership_number":null},{"title":"Formula SAE","membership_type":"Chassis, Uprights and Electronics","membership_number":null}],"location":null,"input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunny-wong","linkedin_id":"sunny-wong","activity":[{"interaction":"Liked by Sunny Wong, Ph.D.","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pretip-raj-raja-ram-mudhaliar-848906136_based-on-experience-having-good-colleagues-activity-7288462050912083969-kwBv","title":"Based on experience, having good colleagues always helps you excel in your job.","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHrcx5-hcrWxw/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZSXRnKEHsAo-/0/1737704764568?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=svRxZpyUH456-ZJ6JP4Kcraxu5HFFBFvq0Uv8oGNCRA","id":"7288462050912083969"},{"interaction":"Liked by Sunny Wong, Ph.D.","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amazon-project-kuiper_projectkuiper-satelliteconnectivity-activity-7288305396602019840-GfYz","title":"Here's a quick look at the progress at our production facility in Kirkland, Washington!

All new assignments are readily accepted and understood with what is usually less than the average learning curve. Kevin shows resilience with the execution of his job functions which is a direct reflection of his core skills and work ethic. Kevin is an innovative self-starter, who rarely requires supervision. He is punctual, almost always exceeds expectations, manages stress well and voluntarily does whatever is required to meet a deadline to get the job done. Kevin is also a team player and exhibits ‘Teamwork with focus’ at the highest levels. Kevin handles challenges that come and is able to balance projects and multitask accordingly to do the best job possible. He thinks outside the box and ensures that all projects progress to a successful completion. Kevin gives 110% to every task and is an essential part of the team’s success. Kevin is a professional, Senior Software Engineer of the highest caliber, who meticulously researches, writes code, tests code, and certifies product functionality he develops and works with. It is not uncommon for management and employees in technical support, engineering, technical training and other departments to praise his work. ”","Agnes Grenci “I worked with Kevin for several years on an Agile team developing and testing a file transfer product that runs on the z/OS platform at CA Technologies. During that time I was always impressed with his abilities and how quickly he picked up the knowledge he needed to become a valuable addition to the development staff. He brought a fresh face to the team by coming up with suggestions and ideas to make the product more user friendly and always abided by the evaluation of whatever his team mates came up with when they were reviewing his ideas. He was also not afraid to ask questions when he was not sure about anything he was currently developing and always reached out to the more senior team members to get the answers and knowledge he needed to get his work done. He would always volunteer to help anyone when he got his work done during the sprint or when some task came up during our scrum meetings. He was a great worker and was diligent in getting the work that was assigned to him done within the time lines given to our team. I performed Quality Assurance tasks for the same product that Kevin did development work on and he made it very easy for me to approach him whenever I had questions and or found something that might have been a bug with his code. We worked together to go over whatever I ran into and then determined the next action to be done. If I was confused about how a feature worked, he would always take the time to go over what was confusing me and explain the feature in great detail and sometimes even drew a picture so that it was very clear to me how I needed to test that particular feature. This made my job so much easier because of his willingness to work with me as well as all the team members no matter what their role was. He was a great asset to our team because he interfaced so well with everyone and I really enjoyed working with him on this product. I highly recommend Kevin for any development or related position because of his dedication and pride in the work he did when I worked with him. I believe he would be a great addition to any development team because of his experience and knowledge he gained during his time working at CA Technologies.”"],"followers":650,"connections":500,"current_company_company_id":"amazon-fulfillment-technologies-robotics","current_company_name":"Amazon Fulfillment Technologies & Robotics","location":"Robesonia","input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-cherry-75363214","linkedin_id":"kevin-cherry-75363214","activity":[{"interaction":"Liked by Kevin Cherry","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryancahalane_new-updated-list-find-it-here-https-activity-7287818212862275584-RDdl","title":"🚨NEW UPDATED LIST 🚨 Find it here: https://lnkd.in/eygjpqtt --- I asked, and you answered… (well a customer asked me first!).

From Data Mining Approaches","start_date":"Dec 2014","description":"With the rapid growth in the credit industry, credit scoring models have become essential and been extensively used for the credit admission evaluations to control the risk of default and thus to reduce the loss to the debtor. In this project, we applied traditional statistical models (i.e. LRA, LDA, QDA, Regularized LRA and SVM) on two credit data sets from Australia and Germany from UCI, analyzed and made comparisons of the classification accuracy from each model for each data set. Based on these results, we will then apply advanced methods (i.e. Random Forests, decision tree, SVM with three approaches to find the best parameters) to confirm these cutting edge technologies lead to better accuracy."},{},{"title":"An Application of MCMC: Google PageRank","start_date":"Apr 2014","description":"Examined and simulated the first algorithm for Google search engine using Java"},{"title":"Stochastic processes with Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods","start_date":"Jun 2013","description":"Dissertation"},{"title":"Computational Methods in Statistics","start_date":"Mar 2010","description":"Identified and documented computational packages in R (MCMC, Jackknife and Cross-validation, Bootstrap, EM algorithm)"},{"title":"Economic Forces and the Stock Market","start_date":"Mar 2013","end_date":"May 2013","description":"An empirical study of the effect different economic indicators had on the US stock market during the decade 2003-2013.

been a lead and contributor to several of the projects I have managed in Ericsson and Telcordia Technologies. In each of the projects, Fan has brought strong domain knowledge, architectural and design skills, technical expertise and a strong commitment to getting the job done. He has been a strong team player in every sense of the word. On the adaptive inventory product, he was able to lead a team of developers and testers taking a conceptual software architecture through requirements, design and implementation. When completed on time, it was a highly configurable and scalable framework with business logic supporting both the GUI and external APIs needs. He was able to clearly communicate the work to the team at large during the demos which were required as part of our SDLC. In closing, I would gladly have Fan on any of my projects as he brings not only the required technical skillset but also the right attitude and work ethic. I know he will find continued success as a system architect or a senior software engineer. Regards, Peter Babigian”","Kai-Ling Kuo “Fan is an exceptional developer. I have worked with him a long time within Ericsson. Not only is he extremely knowledgeable, he is also focused on the goals and would do whatever he needs to accomplished them. He is quick to grasp new technologies and has a great attention to quality. In addition, he is always willing to share his knowledge and experience with other team members. I would not hesitate to have the opportunity to work with him again in any project.

Verlag","date":"September 21, 2011","description":"- Second highest downloaded article in the journal and has been handpicked by the editor in chief as one of the most intriguing articles for the period Sep 2011 to Jul 2012- In this paper, we try to present the problem of epoch detection from a different perspective that not only deals with estimation of epoch instances, but also with quantification of the absence of epochs in the unvoiced regions of speech signal. Most of the epoch detection methods perform significantly well in the voiced regions of speech but are not robust enough in the unvoiced regions of speech. We propose a simple method based on Teager Energy Operator (TEO) which not only determines the epochs in voiced region but also is very effective in unvoiced region. Due to the noise suppression capability of TEO, the proposed method has almost no or little effect against signal degradations like white, babble, high frequency and vehicle noises as compared to 0-Hz resonator and DYPSA methods."},{"title":"Energy Separation Algorithm Based Spectrum Estimation for Formant Estimation from Very Short Durations of Speech","subtitle":"Speech Communication (Elsevier)","description":"-A novel algorithm based on Energy Separation Algorithm (ESA) and digital resonators is developed in this paper that estimates formants from just 1 ms of voiced speech signals. This formant estimation spectrum gives much sharper -3dB bandwidths in the case of female speech and nasal formants as opposed to state-of-the-art LP spectrum."}],"projects":[{"title":"Indian Tiffin Service - iOS and Android App","start_date":"Feb 2017","end_date":"Present","description":"• Leading a team of 4 for developing a food ordering and delivery tracking app for a Client"},{"title":"Bluffathon - iOS Swift App","start_date":"May 2016","end_date":"Aug 2016","description":"• Conceptualized and improvised the idea of this multiplayer party game based on deceit, bluffs, spotting and elimination• Primary contributor in a team of 2 - including defining and designing UX of the entire app"},{}],"location":"Green Bay","input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikant-viswanath-a09a683a","linkedin_id":"srikant-viswanath-a09a683a","activity":[{"interaction":"Liked by Srikant Viswanath","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/capt-shashank-shandilya-1234a41a_pooja-singhal-an-ias-officer-is-in-custody-activity-7259466856963481602-RP3o","title":"Pooja Singhal, an IAS officer, is in custody for embezzling MGNREGA funds meant for the poorest of the poor.

more than six years. During those years I witnessed Vardhany’s dedication to work, excellence in resolving issues and her ability to work with multiple disciplines: management, development, requirement, installation and deployment teams. She was respected by all the team members and was always appreciated for her contribution to the product quality and customer experience. Vardhany has shown great clarity and focus and contributed to CI/CD, automation of regression testing and the process improvement. She has also demonstrated the ability to lead teams and carry out various roles as required by product teams with excellence. She was promoted to the manager position over the course of these years. I strongly believe that she will expand the horizon of any team she joins. ”","LinkedIn User “When Vardhany first joined our project, she was the key lead on our test team. Vardhnay applied a strong customer focus to ensure product quality. This often meant that she had to challenge senior staff members when issues were discovered to ensure that they were fully dealt with before product releases were made available. She never shrunk from this and successfully negotiated reasonable resolutions that met the interests of customers and the product. When she was made a development team manager, she was handed the assignment to manage some newly-formed teams to address some urgent \"platform\" issues, in such areas as upgrade, security, and CI/CD flows. There were several challenges that she had to deal with, including the loose definition/prioritization of the work items and ensuring that the new teams (who were largely Java application developers) gained the additional competencies that they would need to perform those tasks. Vardhany worked diligently to define the tasks that she thought were most important, presenting to both upper management and the teams to gain consensus and understanding. She initiated training for the team members and monitored the work closely to adjust tasks as necessary and deal with unexpected issues. As a result, the teams expanded their skills and, with Vardhany's leadership, were able to begin addressing the complex issues that we needed to solve. Vardhany is able to apply sound judgement to a variety of problems and is able to break down complex goals into manageable tasks. She is a relentless and passionate customer advocate and drives teams' to the best solutions. She is a great team player and is able to quickly pivot when task priorities change. We have been lucky to have Vardhany on our team, and her skills can easily be applied in many areas. ”"],"followers":952,"connections":500,"current_company_company_id":"amazon","current_company_name":"Amazon","location":null,"input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vardhany-darbha","linkedin_id":"vardhany-darbha","activity":null,"linkedin_num_id":"2580404","banner_image":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/5q92mjc5c51bjlwaj3rs9aa82","honors_and_awards":null,"similar_profiles":[{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/luyingpan","name":"Luying Pan","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/luyingpan"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hajamaideen","name":"Haja Maideen","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hajamaideen"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephbueno","name":"Joseph Bueno","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephbueno"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlglewis","name":"Carl Lewis","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlglewis"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikasdhaka","name":"Vikas Dhaka","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikasdhaka"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/csteague7","name":"Charles Teague","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/csteague7"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashi-sharma-3b43a164","name":"Rashi Sharma","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashi-sharma-3b43a164"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/holmanjacob","name":"Jacob Holman","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/holmanjacob"},{"url":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/kim-sai-tan-8584845","name":"Kim Sai Tan","title":null,"url_text":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/kim-sai-tan-8584845"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jatizon","name":"Jose Tizon","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jatizon"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterjolson","name":"Peter Olson","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterjolson"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tushar-pandit","name":"Tushar Pandit","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tushar-pandit"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/beryltomay","name":"Beryl Tomay","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/beryltomay"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ketulmehta","name":"Ketul Mehta","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ketulmehta"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/htewari","name":"Hardik Tewari","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/htewari"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-drozdowski-04890679","name":"Tom Drozdowski","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-drozdowski-04890679"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahyash1993","name":"Yash P Shah","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahyash1993"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayshah1210","name":"Jay Shah","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayshah1210"},{"url":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/rajatbansal77","name":"Rajat Bansal","title":null,"url_text":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/rajatbansal77"},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/skkrishnan","name":"Sunil(Sunny) Krishnan","title":null,"url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/skkrishnan"}],"default_avatar":false,"timestamp":"2025-01-26T19:09:46.543Z","input":{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vardhany-darbha"}},{"id":"ilyasamoylov","name":"Ilya Samoylov","city":"Ridgewood, New Jersey, United States","country_code":"US","about":"Backend Software Engineer with hands-on experience designing and developing backend…","current_company":{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon?trk=public_profile_topcard-current-company","name":"Amazon","company_id":"amazon"},"experience":null,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasamoylov","people_also_viewed":[{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhengzhong423?trk=public_profile_browsemap-profile","name":"Zhong Zheng","about":null,"location":"Fremont, CA"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chengziyu?trk=public_profile_browsemap-profile","name":"Ziyu Cheng","about":null,"location":"Los Angeles, CA"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/sairamsankaran?trk=public_profile_browsemap-profile","name":"Sairam Sankaran","about":null,"location":"Bengaluru"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/suyash-wattamwar29?trk=public_profile_browsemap-profile","name":"Suyash Wattamwar","about":null,"location":"Kent, OH"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anand-kulkarni1?trk=public_profile_browsemap-profile","name":"Anand Kulkarni","about":null,"location":"Sunnyvale, CA"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yitian-li?trk=public_profile_browsemap-profile","name":"Yitian Li","about":null,"location":"Mountain View, CA"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhencong-li-4a2590104?trk=public_profile_browsemap-profile","name":"Zhencong Li","about":"Snap Inc.

Tac Toe","start_date":"Sep 2015","description":"In order to play around with an algorithm that was taught in my undergraduate Artificial Intelligence class, I decided to put together this game of tic tac toe. The algorithm used is the Minimax algorithm and it is written in C while the webapp is served by the Flask framework. Give it a try and see if you have what it takes to defeat the machine! The source can be found on Github!"},{"title":"Where RU Professor","start_date":"Feb 2015","description":"A simple web app that lets a user search for all the classes that a Rutgers New Brunswick professor teaches based on the professor's last name. As of right now the 'all' search queries the entire Rutgers Schedule of Classes via GET requests hence the search will take a few minutes. Specifying a department speeds up the query, but in the future I plan to just copy the entire schedule of classes into a local database which would then drastically speed up the search. The source can be found on Github!"},{"title":"Letters Game","start_date":"2015","description":"A basic game written purely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and jQuery). The rules of the game are simple, don't let any letter hit the right side of the box or you lose. You gain one point for a correct letter hit and you lose one point for an incorrect letter hit. This fun little game definitely helped me strengthen my JavaScript and exposed me to the various considerations that have to go into when developing a game for the web. The source can be found on Github!"},{"title":"Random Filler","start_date":"2014","description":"This basic Chrome Extension aids in testing of web registration forms. While developing a registration form for the GSAPP 50th Anniversary Gala, I ended up filling out the form that I was coding many times. After trying many varying form filling Chrome Extensions, I have decided that they were either too complicated or did not have the features that I wanted thus I became motivated to bring Random Filler to life. All I really wanted from a form filler is the option to just throw truly random nonsense data in the fields or be able to use a few realistic looking edge test cases. The extension is available for download in the Chrome Store. The source to the extension can be found on my Github."},{"title":"Wiki Translate","start_date":"2014","description":"A simple Flask/MongoDB web app that utilizes Wikipedia API (along with Wikipedia python library) to fetch Wikipedia translations for words/phrases. A dictionary translation is given on the side for comparison by Yandex.Translate. For instance, have you ever wondered how the movie \"Limitless\" is called in Polish or any other language? If you have, the only way to find out would be to search Wikipedia for the English version and look on the side for other language translations. Wikipedia Translate does exactly this with a click of a button! The source can be found on my Github!"},{"title":"The Terminal Site","start_date":"2013","description":"When I initially started creating my personal site I had a hard time coming up with a decent design, thus during that stage I came up with an idea to just make my site into a Ubuntu terminal. I actually ended up finishing my personal site first and then got to creating a terminal version. What I mean by terminal version is that you can browse the content of the site in the same manner in which you navigate a terminal."}],"location":null,"input_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/szczurko","linkedin_id":"szczurko","activity":[{"interaction":"Liked by Pawel Szczurko","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/founderlodge_stepchangework-raised-4000000-in-their-activity-7287683312616120320-ak_e","title":"StepChange.work raised $4,000,000 in their Seed Round-Congrats Niall O'Higgins, Harry Tormey Full Round Info: https://lnkd.in/gG72_k2w Round…","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFB9uQh2b5Y_w/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZSMNWknHoAo-/0/1737519098717?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=nnZofqCQGorCBJmcvZqZwNFOKJ7MzzZgzgcVw0Zxoo0","id":"4000000"},{"interaction":"Liked by Pawel Szczurko","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/leonardloo_two-of-voltades-swe-interns-completed-their-activity-7277314062152081408-cLWK","title":"Two of Voltade's SWE interns completed their internship today. 💅💅 When Sean Teh first joined, he didn’t know how to send a POST request.
